# RSCustomBrowser
Custombrowser with xib file and a custom popoverview included in it.


Steps to use:

Refer to the sample application for using the custom browser, which is now in xib format, but will be later changed to custom class, which I'm working on right now.


The PopOverView is another custom class which is in its raw form, please make use of it.
